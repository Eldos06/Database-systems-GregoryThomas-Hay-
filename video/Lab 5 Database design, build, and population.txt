Each student will take the entities STUDENT, TASK, REVIEW_TYPE, TASK_TYPE, RATING, STUDENT_TASK, and REVIEW and conduct the following:

Draw a database design in 3NF (PK/FK and proper crow's foot notation)
Write the CREATE TABLE statements to establish each table with the following conditions:
Appropriate primary keys (integer data type, surrogate, and auto-increment)
ALTER TABLE statements for all foreign keys
Write the INSERT INTO statements to populate 5 rows into each entity that does NOT have a foreign key
Write the SQL to create 'nested' stored procedures to get each foreign key ID value when provided a name
This requires proper use of parameters and variables
Be aware that there may be a need to have a multiple table JOIN statements in the GetID procedures!
Write the SQL to INSERT a single value into an associative entity with a STORED PROCEDURE that calls the nested procedures  
include proper error-handling if any variable happens to be NULL
Include explicit transaction named J1
Write the SQL to create and enforce the following business rule:
"No student younger than 18 may be assigned a task of type 'physical labor' on any Friday"
Hint: this requires capturing birthdate, task date, as well as using DATEPART() function!
Write the SQL to create a computed column that calculates the lifetime total number of tasks assigned to each student
Hint: this includes a User-Defined Function that takes in a parameter!
